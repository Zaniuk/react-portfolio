        <h1>About me</h1>
        <p>My path in technology started when I was 4 years old, when I was given a HP Pavilio 7910 PC. With that machine that accompained me until I reached my teens, I discovered the Internet, and the world of hardware and programming, learning HTML, CSS and Python.
          Since 2018 I work as freelance and self-employed computer technical support. In 2021 I intend to dedicate myself to fully studying programming, something that I'm passionate about and motivates me every day to continue learning more and more. Today I would say that my main language is JavaScript but I'm open to new languages and technologies.</p>

        <h1>Why me?</h1>
        <p>I am a self-taught person, who does not find it difficult to ask or help his colleagues. I tend to take many initiatives, learn quickly, I have knowledge of SCRUM and KANBAN. I am passionate about constantly learning and solving problems and everything I do is done with the passion and ambition to grow as a person and as a professional.</p>

        <h1>What makes me different?</h1>
        <p>Something that sets me apart from the rest is my ability to learn, both self-taught and in a more formal way, proof of this is that I have been moving through different fields of technology, such as technical support for computers, sale of technological supplies, and maintenance of industrial machines (CNC).
          I am confident that my learning abilities, quick adaptability, commitment and ambitions for growth make me the best candidate for your team.</p>
