      <h1>About me</h1>
      <p>My path in technology started when I was 4 years old, when I was given a HP Pavilio 7910 PC. With that machine that accompained me until I reached my teens, I discovered the Internet, and the world of hardware and programming, learning HTML, CSS and Python.
        Since 2018 I work as freelance and self-employed computer technical support. In 2021 I intend to dedicate myself to fully studying programming, something that I'm passionate about and motivates me every day to continue learning more and more. Today I would say that my main language is JavaScript but I'm open to new languages and technologies.</p>
